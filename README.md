# serkis

`serkis` is a simple and powerful personal wiki. A proper README is coming soon.

## Things it does (or will do):

1. [x] Work interoperably with your normal Markdown notetaking habits
2. [x] Put your notes behind an auth wall
3. [x] Allow you to edit your files online (via mobile, or desktop, or potato-with-a-brower-and-internet-connection)
4. [ ] Share specific files with your friends or co-workers or parents
